# Amazon-Jobs-Advanced

This repository contains a Tampermonkey script designed for use with the Tampermonkey plugin in Chrome. 

## Description
This is an advanced version of the original [Amazon-Jobs](https://github.com/sarang7even/Amazon-Jobs) repository. While the original script automated job applications, this version improves efficiency by:
- Fetching job and schedule IDs directly from Amazon's API.
- Automatically navigating to the consent page.
- Skipping unnecessary steps, making the application process seamless.

## Key Features
- Uses Amazon API to fetch job details.
- Advanced logic for handling job and schedule matching.
- Fully automated application process.

## Learning Experience
In creating this program, I learned:
- How to make API requests (GET and POST) effectively.
- Using tools like Postman for testing and debugging API calls.

This program was a masterpiece, combining automation with API handling to streamline the job application process.

## Installation
1. Install the [Tampermonkey plugin](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your Chrome browser.
2. Copy the script from `job_schedule_finder.js` into a new Tampermonkey script.
3. Enable the script and navigate to the Amazon jobs portal.
